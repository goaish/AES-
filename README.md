**AES Implementation in C**
___________________________
This is a very simple (and NOT a highly optimized and secure) implementation of AES only written to teach you the BASICS of this algorithm. I used a tutorial previously available on progressive-coding.com to write the C code in this reposistory. The original link to that website is broken and the tutorial is no longer available on the web. You can still find an older version of the tutorial on cboard.cprogramming.com.

I revised the article, added some comprehensive images, and rewrote it in Markdown and put it here in the README.md of my code.
